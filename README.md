## Golong Flister package
#### A wrapper around Mat Ryer's filedb package for listing and searching filesystems
The f(ile)lister package is intended for consumption by the SVN Finder application developed for the Tesla Reman team. The package handles large listings of files and provides and API for searching and rebuilding the database. It is intentional that adding and deleting are not currenlty features of the database.
